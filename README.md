    <b>This API is designed to practice and demonstrate caching using Laravel with Redis. The project includes a comprehensive study and implementation of caching strategies, focusing on handling and storing various types of data, including images and video. To manage this content, a storage system has been integrated into the API.
Additionally, the project incorporates seeders, migrations, and factories to facilitate testing and ensure robust development practices. These features help simulate a simple real-world scenarios and support the development and testing of the caching mechanisms and data storage functionalities.
